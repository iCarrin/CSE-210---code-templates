Basil~~64~~FullSun to Partial~~Rich Soil~~False~~Miscellaneous~~Make a late spring planting of seedlings started indoors or purchased. In summer, after the soil is warm, sow more basil wherever you want it to grow.~~Harvest leaves a few at a time as you need them in the kitchen. In midsummer, cut plants back by half to stimulate new growth, and make big batches of pesto with the trimmings.~~||~~|||APRICOT|CHILI PEPPER|COTTON|PEPPER|POTATOES|TOMATOE~~Cover transplants with flowerpots to shade them from strong sun for 2 days or so. To keep new leafy branches coming on, pinch off the upright flower spikes as they appear. Plants that slowly wilt to death and show a dark ring on their stems near the soil line are infected with fusarium wilt.
Pepper~~196~~FullSun to FullSun~~Well drained soil that hold moisture well.~~False~~Solanaceae~~Start indoors, and set out seedlings when the soil is settled and warm. Mulch to keep soil lightly moist at all times.~~Peppers can be harvested when they are still green, though their flavor improves as they ripen to red, yellow, or orange.~~||BASIL|BEAN|BORAGE|BUCKWHEAT|CHIVES|CILANTRO|DILL|GARLIC|LEEK|MARJORAM|OREGANO|ROSEMARY|SNAPDRAGON~~|~~Hot weather can cause peppers to temporarily stop flowering. They will pick up again when nights cool down. Tie heavy-bearing plants to a single stake to keep them from falling over.
Grape Vine~~32041~~FullSun to FullSun~~Well-drained soil enriched with plenty of compost.~~False~~Miscellaneous~~Set out purchased plants in spring, just as the buds on the canes begin to swell. Container-grown plants can be transplanted into early summer. Most wine grapes are grafted onto disease-resistant rootstocks, with the graft union quite high, well above the soil line.~~Watch grape clusters closely as they approach ripeness, and pick off individual berries with dark spots or other issues. Use tulle netting if needed to protect the fruits from birds. When a taste tells you it's time to harvest, cut clusters from the vine in the morning, while the fruit is cool, and move it to a refrigerator or cooler. Postpone washing until just before the grapes are used.~~|AGASTACHE|ALYSSUM|CHIVES|CRIMSON CLOVER|GARLIC|GERANIUM|NASTURTIUM|PEAS~~~~Grapes are very site-specific plants, so take time to gather information about locally-adapted varieties before deciding on a planting plan. Grant favor to disease resistant varieties recommended by local fruit experts or wine makers, depending on your goal. To keep the vines healthy and productive, established grapes require thoughtful pruning twice a year, in spring and late summer. Once you have chosen a variety, learn about its pruning needs, and the type of trellis recommended for its support. Grape foliage and fruits are subject to numerous diseases. Powdery mildew is common, and in the US grapes are a favorite food of Japanese beetles. Check plants often for signs of trouble, and clip out unhealthy branches. Protect young plants from browsing by deer.
